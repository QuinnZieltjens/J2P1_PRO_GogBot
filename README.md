# Project
For this school project I needed to create a game using Unity. I decided upon trying to repeat some of the mechanics found in the game [Baba is You](https://store.steampowered.com/app/736260/Baba_Is_You/).

## prototype 1
This was a very primitive version only really having the movement mechanic and the level built.


## prototype 2
In this version I mainly worked on adding it so the "rules" of the game can be edited.

## prototype 3
This final version I made all the levels.

## What I learned
I learned that Unity isn't the tool for me. My main concern this project was making _my code_ work with how Unity works.
